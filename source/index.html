          <p>Recent years have seen an uptick in the use of private-sector data and analytical expertise for public good through <a href="http://datacollaboratives.org/">Data Collaboratives</a> – the cross-sector exchange of data and data science expertise to create new public value.</p>
          <p>Around the world and across sectors, the private sector – from SMEs to international civil society organizations to multinational corporations – are collaborating with the public sector, academia and civil society in leveraging <a href="http://datacollaboratives.org/explorer.html">their data</a> to address some of society’s biggest challenges.</p>

          <p>While data collaboratives are capable of creating public value, they require significant and time-consuming efforts from both data holders on the supply side, and institutions that represent the demand.</p>

          <p>To yield a more actionable understanding of whether and how blockchain and other DLTs can propel social change, we need to move from a faith-based to an evidence-based approach.</p>

          <p>The first phase of Blockchange will seek to test the hypothesis that by applying blockchain attributes to identity management, a trusted digital ID can be created that can benefit, for instance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/ic4d/counting-uncounted-11-billion-people-without-ids">estimated 1.1 billion people</a> who are unable to prove their identity to the satisfaction of authorities and other organizations – often excluding them from property ownership, free movement, and social protection as a result;</li>

            <li>All the <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/identification-development-its-potential-empowering-women-and-girls">women and girls</a>, who disproportionately struggle to obtain IDs, often the result of barriers related to: freedom of travel, distance, financial costs, time constraints, illiteracy, lack of information and awareness, and lack of support from family members.</li>

          <p>To become smarter about the application of blockchain technologies for identity, Blockchange will initially seek to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Map, and provide a taxonomy of blockchain technologies that seeks to provide identity;</li>
            <li>Develop a primer on the potential and challenges of blockchain technologies across the identity life-cycle (such as creation; verification; authentication; and authorization);</li>
            <li>Map the actual use of identity provided through blockchain technologies for a variety of social good purposes through case studies; and</li>
